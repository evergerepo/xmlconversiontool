# xmlconversiontool

Steps to run the tool -

1. Please download the zip file from the following link - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iQqHf8Xf5HwuZYuhx0La3rnf0fHniDSI
2. Unzip it and place it in a convenient location on your desktop.
3. Go to that folder and look for refine.bat. Click on the file. This should generate a file in the dest folder.
4. Before clicking on the refine.bat file, please make sure that the input file is placed in the source folder and the dest folder should be empty.

P.S The source code here is for generating the jar which is being referred from the bat file. Bat file should be outside of the jar. You can see that from the link mentioned in #1.
